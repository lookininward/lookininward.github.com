            <p>Worked with the industrial tool manufacturing company <b>E-CUT</b>, to design and build their home page and product gallery. The Taiwanese commpany wanted to establish their presence on the web and become more accessible to their clients. Their entire product gallery is represented with detailed specifications, accompanying photos, and serves as a searchable database for clients to find the tools and parts they require. This was the first time designing and building a custom WordPress theme. It opened my eyes up to the way that frameworks are built off a language like PHP.</p>

        <p>Indra is a professional real estate agent working the Greater Toronto Area. She has years of prior experience in the finacial sector specializing in mortgages and mortgage insurance. Her home page was designed to reflect the quality service, and clear communication she conducts on behalf of her clients. This is one of the first sites I built using PHP and really began to understand and take advantage of templating capabilities.</p><br/>
